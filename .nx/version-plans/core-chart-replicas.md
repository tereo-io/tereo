The Helm chart takes `service.annotations`, for sticky sessions when running more than one API pod (socket.io's long-polling fallback needs every request of a session on one pod). API pods get a `preStop` delay (`preStopSleepSeconds`, default 5) so the ingress stops routing to a pod before it shuts down, with the grace period extended by the same amount.
