## 0.1.1 (2026-10-15)

### 🩹 Fixes

- Linted with ESLint 10. An SMTP host that fails to resolve now keeps the resolver's error as the `cause` of the one core logs; the delivery still records only "The SMTP host did not resolve". ([#1](https://github.com/tereo-io/tereo/pull/1))
- A Helm chart, `oci://ghcr.io/tereo-io/charts/tereo`, released with the image at the same version. It reads Postgres, Redis and `CORE_KEK` from a Secret you provide or one External Secrets builds, runs migrations as a pre-install and pre-upgrade hook, and refuses to render a configuration core would refuse at start. ([#2](https://github.com/tereo-io/tereo/pull/2))
- OpenTelemetry moves to `sdk-node` 0.223 and `auto-instrumentations-node` 0.81, which clears every moderate `npm audit` finding. ([#1](https://github.com/tereo-io/tereo/pull/1))
- The Prisma CLI in the image uses `mysql2` 3.24 and `deepmerge-ts` 8 in place of the versions Prisma pins, which carry open advisories. `npm audit` reports no vulnerabilities. ([#1](https://github.com/tereo-io/tereo/pull/1))
- `sharp` moves to 0.35, which brings a libvips with fixes for CVE-2026-33327, CVE-2026-33328, CVE-2026-35590 and CVE-2026-35591, and `dotenv` to 18. ([#1](https://github.com/tereo-io/tereo/pull/1))
- Two concurrent first sign-ins with one email, through an invite or a domain, again end as one user and an `account_exists` for the other. Since Prisma 7.10 a unique violation names only its index, which the race handling did not read. ([#1](https://github.com/tereo-io/tereo/pull/1))
- Background jobs run on BullMQ 6 and `ioredis` 6. Stopping a worker while Redis is unreachable still drops BullMQ's blocking connection rather than leaving it reconnecting. ([#1](https://github.com/tereo-io/tereo/pull/1))
- Dependencies updated within their ranges, among them Prisma 7.10, `multer` 2.4, `undici` 6.29, `socket.io` 4.8.4 and Vite 8.3, which clears the `npm audit` findings those ranges could fix. ([#1](https://github.com/tereo-io/tereo/pull/1))
